# Portfolio Site for Josh Cobert

This is a website to introduce myself and showcase projects I have worked on.

The site is styled with custom CSS using the Sass preprocessor, along with the help of the Bootstrap framework, as well as some vanilla JavaScript. 

I plan in future iterations to incorporate technologies such as React and perhaps add some backend functionality to add a contact form or other nifty features.
